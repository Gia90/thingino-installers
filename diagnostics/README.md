# diagnostics

Havig issues with your cam but it still plays the chime when you tap the button? This image will automatically gather
a diagnostics log you can analyze yourself or share with the developers! Burn the image wit hyour favorite sd image burner
(I recommend Raspbery Pi Imager), po pthe sd into the cam, and in a few seconds you should hear it spaking italian. That means
it's safe to remove the sd card and pop it into your pc to look at the log!
