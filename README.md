Files and tools for installing Thingino firmware on various supported camera models

# NOTE: Follow the README in the subdirectory named for your camera, THIS OVERRIDES WHAT I SHOW IN A VIDEO

# A note about UPDATES

The images in the installers are updated once a week, you probably want to do a full upgrade after installing!

# More Info

I have install videos for each model listed at https://www.youtube.com/@wltechblog

# Want to build your own?

The included script make_images.sh will create all the install images. Note that firmware images are cached between runs for speed and to 
allow for version pinning.

# DISCLAIMER

The instructions and tools provided are best effort and were tested on the specific devices I purchased. Future hardware
and software revisions may cause problems, and maybe even break your camera (unlikely!). If your device doesn't flash as expected,
please file a bug with details or better yet, join our Discord and we can help diagnose it together. This is a hobbyist project
and no warranty is implied! Generally speaking you can only break these cameras if you hit them with something, but some devices
are easier for tinkering than others.
