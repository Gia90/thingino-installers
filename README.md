Files and tools for installing Thingino firmware on various supported camera models

# NOTE: Follow the README in the subdirectory named for your camera, THIS OVERRIDES WHAT I SHOW IN A VIDEO

# A note about UPDATES

Thingino is currently in the middle of a big change with some core details, and I suggest that you temporarily resist the urge to update to the current nightly build! I will
post something on my YT channel when we're in the clear but remember the versions of firmware included in these installers should be solid while that process continues!

# More Info

I have install videos for each model listed at https://www.youtube.com/@wltechblog
For support, jump over to the Hacker's Homestead discord channel! https://discord.gg/s6yJzhS4hD

# Want to build your own?

The included script make_images.sh will create all the install images. Note that firmware images are cached between runs for speed and to 
allow for version pinning.

# DISCLAIMER

The instructions and tools provided are best effort and were tested on the specific devices I purchased. Future hardware
and software revisions may cause problems, and maybe even break your camera (unlikely!). If your device doesn't flash as expected,
please file a bug with details or better yet, join our Discord and we can help diagnose it together. This is a hobbyist project
and no warranty is implied! Generally speaking you can only break these cameras if you hit them with something, but some devices
are easier for tinkering than others.
